### Distribution System Research
- Developed the “Ko Models” for voltage regulation, power loss estimation, feeder reach, and substation planning that continue to guide distribution system optimisation in India.
- Produced ready-reckoner nomograms for field engineers covering voltage regulation, feeder loss, conductor gradation, and pump-set efficiency.

### Tamil Computing and Virtual Education
- Conceived and launched Tamil Virtual University with global study centres, a 200,000-page digital library, dictionaries, and temple video galleries.
- Created Tamil-friendly computing assets: TamilNet99 keyboard, TAM/TAB encoding standards, and the 16-bit TACE16 standard adopted by the Government of Tamil Nadu.
- Nurtured Tamil language technology through Tamil Perayam, diaspora teacher training, and diploma programmes for temple priests.

### Academic Curriculum Innovation
- Introduced the M.Phil. (Computer Science) Summer Sequential Programme and refreshed undergraduate/ postgraduate syllabi across multiple universities.
- Designed courses and laboratories in computer science, including AICTE-funded research labs for pattern recognition, networking, and multimedia computing.
- Championed skill-based curricula, school–university IT bridges (SUITS/SUCCESS), nanotechnology and herbal medicine research centres, and inclusive training for rural youth and differently abled learners.

### Industrial and Societal Impact
- Led national and state-level consultancy on power-distribution planning, transformer efficiency, and micro/mini-hydel viability through Rural Electrification Corporation.
- Guided research collaborations that delivered outcomes such as the SRM nano-satellite, nickel nano-dot memory devices, and herbal formulations through the Interdisciplinary School of Indian Systems of Medicine.
- Advised government and professional bodies (UGC, AICTE, IEEE, Unicode Consortium) on standards for engineering experimentation, higher education, and Tamil language technology.
